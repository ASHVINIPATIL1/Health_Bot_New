    {
      "category": "weight_training",
      "question": "Is weight training good for weight loss?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Weight training builds muscle, which increases your resting metabolic rate. This means you burn more calories even at rest. Combine it with cardio and proper nutrition for best results."

      "category": "cardio_vs_strength",
      "question": "Should I do cardio or strength training?",

      "category": "rest_days",
      "question": "Do I need rest days?",
      "answer": "Yes! Rest days are crucial for muscle recovery and growth. Aim for 1-2 complete rest days per week, or practice active recovery with light activities like walking or yoga."
    },
    {
      "category": "muscle_soreness",
      "question": "Why am I sore after working out?",

    {
      "category": "workout_timing",
      "question": "When is the best time to work out?",

    {
      "category": "post_workout_nutrition",
      "question": "What should I eat after a workout?",
      "answer": "Within 30-60 minutes post-workout, consume protein (20-25g) and carbs to aid recovery. Examples: protein shake with fruit, chicken with rice, Greek yogurt with granola. This helps repair muscles and replenish energy."

    },
    {
      "category": "cool_down",
      "question": "Do I need to cool down after exercise?",
      "answer": "Yes! Cooling down (5-10 minutes of light activity and stretching) helps gradually lower heart rate, prevents blood pooling, reduces muscle stiffness, and aids recovery."
    },
    {
      "category": "hiit_training",
      "question": "What is HIIT training?",
      "answer": "HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) alternates short bursts of intense exercise with recovery periods. Example: 30 seconds sprint, 60 seconds walk, repeat 8-10 times. It's time-efficient and great for fat burning and cardiovascular fitness."
